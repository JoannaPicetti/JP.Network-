Updating JP.network website


I am democratically elected member of the Argentine Congress.

The old corrupted power system pushed me away.

When this publication goes to print (August 2020) there are multiple ongoing legal threads. 

You can type my name (Joanna Picetti) into Google, just be aware of “Fake News”, be careful who you trust.

I am in Estonia to empower humanity and show the way in the face of adversity.

My massive transformative purpose is to create a Unified Global Government. 

The future of Governance is based on modern technology ( blockchain, AI, real-time data ) and I went to Estonia because Estonia is the flagship of the worlds first digital society. 

Every institution that we can see today in our world was created after WW2 (Bretton Woods financial system, United Nations, NATO). They are no longer fit for purpose, we need to change the way we operate as humanity. 

Unified Global Government is a big vision, that is why getting there in stages. 
Special Economic Zones is the direct path towards accomplishing this goal.

Simplifying global trade and adding blockchain trust and transparency can completely change how we do Business.
